FLYING ANIMATION 2 [IDLE/MOVVEMENT]

Hi,

Thanks for purchasing 'Flying Animations 2 [Idle/Moving]! This pack includes 56 animations with various idle and 
movement animations. The bone setup is similar to how you would setup in Mixamo, so you can also use these animation
in conjunction with other mo-cap animations or anything similar. If you plan to use the 'humanoid' avatar, the setting should setup automatically.
If not, check the 'humanoid_avatar.jpg' file on where to place the bones. For using the 'generic' avatar, the root bone is under 'QuickRigCharacter_Reference/QuickRigCharacter_Hips'. If you have any questions, email icuzo2017@gmail.com.

Thank you
