verify colliders during pause for all enemies


bug fixes: 
- player gains points when they collide w/ enemy?
- lock on raycast first check for certain types of collider
- prevent player from shooting if they have been hit in past .5 seconds
- prevent player from moving if they have been hit in the past .1 seconds
- prevent player from losing points from collision if they collide in the past .25 seconds
- check enemy movement avoidance
- first (or last?) bullet problem
- implement player-targeted bullets where the pattern holds its shape




make radar animate on the screen, outline the target in green if it's radar icon is invisible but only if it's not locked on

bullets which force the player to roll
weapons have the same lock on distance
make enemy death explosion based on enemy height
sfx
bullets that track need directional indication (can elongate)
bullets should have slightly smaller collider than visual appearance
